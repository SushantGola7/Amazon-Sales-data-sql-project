Project Overview

This project aims to analyze sales data from an online retail business to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity. By leveraging data wrangling, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we can uncover valuable information that can help drive business decisions and improve sales strategies.

Goals

Product Analysis: Understand the performance of different product lines, identify the best-performing products, and determine areas for improvement.
Sales Analysis: Analyze sales trends to measure the effectiveness of sales strategies and identify opportunities for increasing sales.
Customer Analysis: Uncover different customer segments, their purchase trends, and the profitability of each segment.

Approach

Data Wrangling:

Inspect the data for NULL values and missing values.
Apply data replacement methods to handle missing or NULL values.
Ensure data integrity by setting NOT NULL constraints for each field.

Feature Engineering:

Add a timeofday column to categorize sales into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening.
Add a dayname column to extract the days of the week for each transaction.
Add a monthname column to extract the months of the year for each transaction.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct detailed analysis to answer key business questions and achieve the project goals.
Visualize data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
Provide actionable insights to improve business strategies and operations.

Conclusion

By analyzing the sales data using the techniques outlined above, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing sales performance and customer behavior. This project provides a comprehensive approach to data-driven decision-making, helping the business to optimize its sales strategies and achieve better outcomes.
